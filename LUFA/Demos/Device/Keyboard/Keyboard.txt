 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Keyboard demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a USB Keyboard using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern
 *  OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). It is boot protocol compatible, and thus
 *  works under compatible BIOS as if it was a native keyboard (e.g. PS/2).
 *  
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a keyboard when the USB connection to a host is present. To use
 *  the keyboard example, manipulate the joystick to send the letters
 *  a, b, c, d and e. See the USB HID documentation for more information
 *  on sending keyboard event and key presses.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *  
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>INTERRUPT_CONTROL_ENDPOINT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>When defined, this causes the demo to enable interrupts for the control endpoint,
 *        which services control requests from the host. If not defined, the control endpoint
 *        is serviced via polling using the task scheduler.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>INTERRUPT_DATA_ENDPOINT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>When defined, this causes the demo to enable interrupts for the data endpoints,
 *        which services incoming LED reports and outgoing key status reports to and from the host.
 *        If not defined, the data endpoints are serviced via polling using the task scheduler.</td>
