 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 * This bootloader enumerates to the host as a CDC Class device (virtual serial port), allowing for AVR109
 * protocol compatible programming software to load firmware onto the AVR.	
 *  
 * Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and will fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 * you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 * values in the accompanying makefile.
 *  
 * This bootloader is compatible with the open source application AVRDUDE, or Atmel's AVRPROG.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.

 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>SIGNATURE_0, SIGNATURE_1, SIGNATURE_2</td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>AVR part signature bytes. These are normally defined as part of the AVR device header files in recent avr-libc
 *        distributions. If your avr-libc library is out of date and does not define these values, you can define them
 *        manually in the makefile CDEFS.</td>
